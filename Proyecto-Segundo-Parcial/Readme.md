# Wind Waker Water Shader

This is a _really_ simple Unity Surface Shader that I've styled to look a little like the water from Wind Waker.

It was originally written for an introduction to shader programming course that I taught to 2nd year Game Programming students. As such it's missing
more advanced options like depth fade and reflections, but for a simple, stylised scene, this is a useful example. 

I've exposed all the parameters to control:

* UV Scaling
* UV Scrolling
* UV Sine Movement
* Vertex movement
* Intersection Fade and Colour

It should be trivial to extend to your needs.
